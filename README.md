# CAULFIELD_py_project_part2

I realized that the commit text is a bit squished, so I put it here as well and then some.

The ultimate part of the python project! Added the three python scripts for each part, and all the genomic data required to run them.
I'm sure there is some "easy" way to encode the scripts to pull the genome files from NCBI, but I'm not quite that good yet.
