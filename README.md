# CAULFIELD_py_project_part2
The ultimate part of the python project!

I realized that the commit text is a bit squished, so I put it here as well and then some.

Three python scripts for each part, and all the genomic data required to run them. These genbank and fasta files DO need to be in 
your working directory or else they will not function... but you'd likely be downloading everything in a zipped folder anyway...


Notes for myself looking back on this and also for Laura, who will be looking over this:

>I'm sure there is some "easy" way to encode the scripts to pull the genome files from NCBI, but I'm not quite that good yet.

>For the ruddi_analysis.py there was a weird FutureError message which seemed benign and did not impact the script. A little conused since
 from my understanding of the error message it was a non issue. Just in case, I put a little thing into the code to hopefully deal with it.

>Still relatively new to Pandas, so I couldn't get the dataframe transposition for ruddi to work how I wanted to- though I'm not sure I even had
 to in the first place? Those index values wouldn't budge which I found pretty odd.
